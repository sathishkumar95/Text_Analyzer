Text Analyzer

This part of the program shows a function that counts how many times a character occurs in a string.
def count_char(text, char):
  count = 0
  for c in text:
    if c == char:
      count += 1
  return count

This function takes as its arguments the text of the file and one character, returning the number of times that character appears in the text.
Now we can call it for our file.
filename = input("Enter a filename: ")
with open(filename) as f:
  text = f.read()

print(count_char(text, "r"))

Result:
>>>
Enter a filename: test.txt
83
>>>

The character "r" appears 83 times in the file.
